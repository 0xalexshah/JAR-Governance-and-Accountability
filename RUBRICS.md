# RUBRICS: Measurement Methodology and Scoring Thresholds

This document contains the two canonical rubrics used to score the 13 Level 4 (L4) indicators in the comparative audit of Organizational Governance and Compliance & Claims Integrity. All scoring was conducted via Human Interactive Judgment (HIJ), using these explicit thresholds to ensure reproducible interpretation of evidence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Scoring Metrics for Organizational Governance (HIJ)

This rubric evaluates the maturity and resilience of internal governance structures, assigning higher scores based on the degree to which safety and accountability are hard-coded into the corporate legal structure, rather than relying on executive discretion.

| Score | Classification | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5** | **Structural/Constitutional** | Governance is "hard-coded" into the company’s legal bylaws or equity structure. It restricts executive power and survives leadership changes. |
| **4** | **Systematized/Productized** | Governance is operationalized into specific software tools (e.g., portals) or dedicated standing departments with clear external interfaces. |
| **3** | **Advisory/Policy-Based** | Processes are defined and robust, but enforcement relies on internal "recommendations" to leadership. The CEO retains veto power. |
| **2** | **Reactive/Opaque** | Mechanisms exist but are triggered only by emergencies, lack public documentation (SLAs), or operate inside a "black box". |
| **1** | **Nominal** | The topic is acknowledged via generic forms or high-level statements, but lacks specific policy implementation. |
| **0** | **Absent** | No evidence of the category exists in public documentation. |

## 2. Scoring Metrics for Compliance & Claims Integrity (HIJ)

This rubric measures the gap between stated ethical principles and external market performance and regulatory adherence, focusing on consumer protection and truth-in-advertising principles.

| Score | Classification | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5** | **Gold Standard (Leader)** | The model/company proactively exceeds regulatory requirements. There is zero evidence of "dark patterns" (manipulative design) or deceptive marketing. |
| **4** | **Strong (Proactive)** | Generally compliant with minor, isolated issues. Safety measures are robust, and business models align with consumer protection. |
| **3** | **Baseline (Compliant)** | Meets the legal minimum (e.g., EU AI Act compliance) but lacks ethical depth. May have "technical" safety but "business" risks (e.g., pricing barriers). |
| **2** | **High Risk (Significant Gaps)** | Evidence of specific failures, such as misleading marketing claims (overclaiming), introduction of addictive mechanics, or regulatory investigations. |
| **1** | **Critical Failure (Red Flag)** | Active engagement in predatory practices (e.g., surveillance advertising to minors) or systemic integrity breaches (e.g., falsified benchmarks). |
